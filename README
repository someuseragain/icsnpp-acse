# ICSNPP-ACSE

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Association Control Service Element (ACSE)

## Overview

This plugin provides a protocol analyzer for Association Control Service
Element (ACSE) (ISO 8650 / X.227) for use within Zeek. The analyzer enables
Zeek to parse ACSE messages.

## Dependencies

As ACSE is an application protocol based on the OSI stack, the underlying ISO
protocol layers must also be processed. The following plugins must therefore
also be installed:

- [TPKT](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-tpkt)
- [COTP](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-iso-cotp)
- [SESS](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-sess)
- [PRES](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-pres)

## Installation

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html).

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install acse
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_ACSE` under the list of plugins.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.
